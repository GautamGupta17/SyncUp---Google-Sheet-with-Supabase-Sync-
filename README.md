# SyncUp---Google-Sheet+Supabase
Two way sync implementation between PostgreSQL (Supabase) and Google Sheets

### Title
Real-time Data Sync between Google Sheets and a Supabase

### Objective
Building a solution that enables real-time synchronization of data between a Google Sheet and a specified database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL). The solution should detect changes in the Google Sheet and update the database accordingly, and vice versa.

### Problem Statement

Many businesses use Google Sheets for collaborative data management and databases for more robust and scalable data storage. However, keeping the data synchronised between Google Sheets and databases is often a manual and error-prone process. The task was to develop a solution that automates this synchronisation, ensuring that changes in one are reflected in the other in real-time.
